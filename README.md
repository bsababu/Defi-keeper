# Defi-keeper

### Building Defi app - keeper on ICP with front-End react


We continued on Keeper react app, we have added the backend with motoko language. - and we added some components.

```bash
cd dKipa/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```


```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.
